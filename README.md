1) Clone this repository & make sure you have necessary frameworks installed, most important being flask & react.
2) Go to cloned repository on your local & run app.py & you should see your running successfully
3) Go to Demyst-app directory wherein react files are present & run npm start.
4) This should launch in your web browser & a form will open asking for business details like name, year & other details.
5) There are 2 buttons provided named 'Check Balance' & 'Submit'.
6) The 'Check Balance' button is not active until all details are filled in the form & 'Submit' is not active until 'Check balance is clicked'
7) Since there were no details about 'Balance sheet' so I made a sheet.json where I filled the balance data (dummy) in the required format.
